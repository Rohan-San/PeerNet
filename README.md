#PROBLEM STATEMENT: Students at Ramaiah Institute of Technology lack a platform for connecting with peers who share similar interests and forming communities. Another problem faced by students is unfamiliarity with affordable dining options. A solution is needed to provide students with an easy and accessible way to find and join communities of like-minded individuals and to navigate good food options.
